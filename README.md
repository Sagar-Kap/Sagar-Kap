### Hello there

I am [Sagar Kapoor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagarkapr/) and my online alias is [Trainee Ninja](https://github.com/Trainee-Ninja). I am completing my Master's education from the University of Sheffield in the subject of Digital Marketing and Social Media, having completed my Economics Honors from India. 

I started programming to automate collection of data for my marketing projects. And now I am falling into a deep pit of coding languages. Here is a window into my descent:

#### 👷 The projects that I am working on:

- [Sagar Kapoor](https://www.sagarkapoor.eu/) - My personal blog, to enumerate my struggle, and point out solutions to problems that newbies like me often come across. 
- [The Indian Economist](https://www.indianeconomist.in/) - My blog related to my Masters and my Bachelor's education. It mostly focuses on ingenious ways to get your online marketing done right.
  - These above sites have been made with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 
- [The Indian Law](https://theindianlaw.in/) - A joint endeavour with my friend to bring forth information about legal subjects in India. A site made with [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/).
